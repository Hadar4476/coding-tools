the update command is for changing and editing values of an existing row,
in the next query I will update the phone number of a row which
this row's id's value is equal to 1:

=> UPDATE contact_log SET phone = '086663321' WHERE id = 1;

sometime I would like to update all the fields of a row, in this case I wont
use WHERE.

update multi fields:

=> UPDATE contact_log SET name = 'Avi 2',phone = '0529987456' WHERE id = 1;
