the function DATE_FORMAT is one of the most common and built-in functions while
working with mysql server. it used for receiving data of a certain date & time.
it is effective on date, datetime and timestamp types etc. the way that mysql
server is saving the date is in the classic british format(Y-m-d/ Year-Month-Day).
I can use this function to set the format to the israeli format for example(d-m-Y).
this function receives 2 arguments:
- the date: a column or an original date.
- the format.

example:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName, 
   DATE_FORMAT(createdAt, '%d/%m/%Y') AS joined_at FROM employees
   ORDER BY joined_at;
