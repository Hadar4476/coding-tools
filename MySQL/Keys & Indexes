"Constraints" can be placed on columns so that they change the behavior
and data retention of the records that will be under those columns.
These constraints are called indexes or in some cases also keys.
There are several indexes that can be set on columns and below is a table
that summarizes each of them and the differences between each index and index:


Index type:                            Description:
----------                             -----------

- Primary key                         - The primary key is the unique identifier of a row (record) in a table.
                                      - In most cases this is a field (column) named id.
                                      - Each row has its own id that can point to one row in the table exactly.
                                        There can be no two lines with the same value of a master key
                                        (I.e. with the same id) as there can be no array of two elements
                                        with the same key
                                      - Of course there is no obligation to call the main field id
                                        or to have numbers at all, But yes the values of the Primary key field
                                        must be different from line to line to identify the line uniquely. 
                                      - The order of getting the results by default will be in the order of
                                        the values in the Primary key field (But can be requested in a different way).  
                                        
 
 
 - Unique key                         - Unique This is a limit on the data in a particular column that says that in
                                        each row in the table, the value of this column must be different, unique.
                                      - There can be no two rows in a table that have the same value in a 
                                        column defined as Uniqe.
                                        
 
- Index                               - This option is given to a field (column) from which multiple retrievals are made,
                                        Because the database relies on it to find the data.
                                      - Improves the speed of retrieving data under this column.
                                      - The search is usually by the LIKE statement or by REGEXP.
                                      
- FULLTEXT                           - Supported by MyISAM and starting with mysql version 5.6.0 also by InnoDB
                                     - Works only on columns that contain text type information like char, varchar, text
                                     - The mysql server indexes each and every word that is valued under the same column.
                                     - Great for free searching of long and functional text like a search engine.
                                     - The search syntax is different and uses the MACTH + AGAINST statement.
