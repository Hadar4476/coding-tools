the ROUND function is used for rounding floats by the rules of rounding:
- for example, 0.0 - 0.4, will always round down.
- for example. 0.5-0.9, will always round up.

=> SELECT ROUND(26.5) AS num;

I can also set how many number I want to display after the . of a float:

=> SELECT ROUND(26.453, 2) AS num;

result: 

num
___
26.45

*important thing to note:
it is possible to set as parameter a name of a column which contains integers.
