the WHERE command is used for stating a condition for receiving
data, I can add another condition with OR:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   WHERE city = 'Tel Aviv' OR city = 'Ramat Gan';
   

there also a possibility to use AND, means that these two conditions must be true:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city,status FROM employees
   WHERE city = 'Ramat Gan' AND status = 1;
