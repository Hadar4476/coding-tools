Relationships means connection between tables. by joining tables I can
receive data from a group of tables.
mysql server is working by a model of relative data base or in other words:
relational database management system(RDBMS).
by this model I can "spread" data from an original data source to more than one tables.

types of relationships:

- one to one relationship
- one to many and many to one relationship
- many to many relationship
- self referencing relationship

the connection between diffrent is used by a column that its values is equal in 
2 tables, on one side table A with column of PRIMARY KEY and on the other side table B
which is called "foreign key":

- a column, in one table, that is defined as "foreign key" is used to relate to another PRIMARY KEY column
  in other table.
- basically, this is a column of a "child table" that is relative to a "parent table".
- for creating a connection between a column from one table to a column from another table: both columns must
  be PRIMARY KEY.
- one table can contain a number of connections by a "foreign key" to diffrent tables(for example: "roles" table).

example for one to one relationship:

                    - Users Table -                                                    - Avatar  Table -
                    
     id:    name:          email:                  password:                      id:     image:            user_id:

     3      Amit           amit@gmail.com          445533321                      3       amit.png          3

     ^                                                                                                      ^ 
     |______________________________________________________________________________________________________|
     

* the id column in "users" table is connected to the user_id column in the "avatar" table.


example for one to many relationship:

     
 - Categories Table -                                         - Products Table -
                    
id:    name:                 id:   categorie_id:   machine_name:             title:              body:              price:   
1      Desktop computers     1     1               some machine name         some machine title  some machine body  54.3       
2      Laptops               2     2               Dell-XPS 15               some dell title     some dell body     26          
3      Computer monitors     3     3               bla bla                   bla bla             bla bla            337.5        
                             4     2               Asus                      Asus title          asus body          420.4
                             5     1               AMD                       AMD title           AMD body           75
                                  
                                  
* in this case the column "id" in the "categories" table is present in the column "categorie_id" in the "products" table
more than once.
