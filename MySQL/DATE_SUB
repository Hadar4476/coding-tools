the function DATE_SUB is very useful and important while working with dates.
it return a date written in the classic british format minus another date:

=> SELECT DATE_SUB("2017-06-15", INTERVAL 10 DAY);

result:

2017-06-05

the INTERVAL state stands for "period of time".

list of time states:

- MICROSECOND
- SECOND
- MINUTE
- HOUR
- DAY
- WEEK
- MONTH
- QUARTER
- YEAR
- SECOND_MICROSECOND
- MINUTE_MICROSECOND
- MINUTE_SECOND
- HOUR_MICROSECOND
- HOUR_SECOND
- HOUR_MINUTE
- DAY_MICROSECOND
- DAY_SECOND
- DAY_MINUTE
- DAY_HOUR
- YEAR_MONTH

example:

let say I want to receive rows from "employees" table that started to work on the last year(only),
until now. there is a very useful function for that called NOW:

=> SELECT * FROM employees 
   WHERE createdAt >= DATE_SUB(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
