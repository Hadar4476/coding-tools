The sentence NOT will constitute a negation of the sentence or
function that follows it. This statement can be placed before almost
any function or statement after which it will bring the exact opposite result.
In the following example, we would like to extract from the product table all
products whose price is not (NOT) between 50 and 100. We can do this with the help
of NOT and with the combination of BETWEEN. We will sort the order of results
by price in ascending order:

NOT BETWEEN:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE price NOT BETWEEN 50 AND 100
   ORDER BY price;
   
   
NOT IN:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   WHERE city NOT IN('Tel Aviv', 'Ramat Gan');
