the LIKE function is useful for searching

* important signs to remember:

- (%) = stands for any combination of notes, not only a single note, not case sensetive.
- (_) = stands for a single note.

example for %:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE title LIKE 'D%'; // possible: WHERE title LIKE 'd&';
   
result:

title:                                             price:
-----                                              -----

Dell IPS UltraSharp U3014                          337.5


before & after:

in the next example I would like to search products under the "products" table,
but only execute their title and price, and I only want to find products that their
title or body contains the string "games".

for example:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE title LIKE '%games%' OR body LIKE '%games%'
   ORDER BY price;
   
result:


title:                                             price:
-----                                              -----

example for _:

in the next example I would to combine % with _.
I would like to search for employees which works in cities that the name of the city
start with the letter R, the name ends with 2 letters and after those letters "n" will come as last letter.

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   WHERE city LIKE 'R%__n';
