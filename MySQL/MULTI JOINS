sometimes I would like to combine data from number of tables
to receive one result. 

in the next example I would like to combine data from 3 diffrent tables.
the connection between "users" table and "premissions" table will rely on
the "role" table(something like a third party):

=> SELECT u.name,p.name pname 
   FROM users u,roles r,permissions p
   WHERE u.id = r.uid AND r.role = p.role_id
   
   
result:
        
        name:         pname:
        --------------------------------
        Admin         admin
        Israel        authenticated user
        
        
        
alternative with JOIN:

=> SELECT u.name,p.name pname FROM users u
   JOIN roles r ON u.id = r.uid
   JOIN permissions p ON r.role = p.role_id;
