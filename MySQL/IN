The IN function is actually a quick and convenient replacement for OR.
It allows us to give a number of options when we place a certain condition
on received records. In the following example, we would like to retrieve information 
from an employee table, but we would only want employees who live either in Tel Aviv
or in Ramat Gan. We can use the IN function to do this:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees 
   WHERE city IN('Tel Aviv', 'Ramat Gan');
