mysql server has many functions and other options with running queries.

COUNT function:

allows counting row.

for example:

=> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;

* important thing to note:
if a certain row we would like to include in our count will have values of NULL,
the rows won't count because the function COUNT dosen't count NULL values.

alias(AS):

after running COUNT, the given name of the received field is "COUNT(*)" by default.
I can change it with adding AS:

=> SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM products;

* important thing to note:
with the modern versions of mysql and mariadb there is no need to mention AS,
it is enough to state the alias after the COUNT function:

=> SELECT COUNT(*) total FROM products;



COUNT DISTINCT:

The DISTINCT statement helps us to sift records whose values are the same so
that we can only get unique values when we run different queries:

=> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) amount FROM employees
   WHERE status = 1;
