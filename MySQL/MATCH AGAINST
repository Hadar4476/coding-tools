the MATCH and AGAINST states are helpful for searching columns that are
defiend as FULLTEXT index(ONLY). these states are also useful for doing a quick search on
long texts. the search can be by a letter or a word, but the performance costs alot
when searching on long and big texts.

example:

the search with MATCH and AGAINST need to be executed by the following steps:

* the MATCH state will receive the name of the column in ().
* the AGAINST state will receive the word or letter I would like to search for in().

*important to note:

in case the table or the database will be defined with utf8_general_ci, the search
won't be case sensetive.

in the example below I would like to search the word "gallery" from the post column at
"articles" table:


=> SELECT * FROM articles
   WHERE MATCH(post) AGAINST('galley');
   

MATCH, AGAINST and OR:

=> SELECT * FROM articles
   WHERE MATCH(post) AGAINST('galley') 
   OR MATCH(post) AGAINST('sometimes');
