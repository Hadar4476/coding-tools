there are several types to "JOIN":

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- JOIN

there is no diffrence between JOIN and INNER JOIN because the default behavior of
mysql server while using JOIN is to use the INNER JOIN instead.

JOIN/INNER JOIN example:

=> SELECT c.name,p.title,p.price FROM products p
   JOIN categories c ON c.id = p.categorie_id
   WHERE p.visibility = 1
   ORDER BY p.price
   LIMIT 3;

result: 

         name:                              title:                               price:

LEFT JOIN example:

the diffrence between connecting two tables with LEFT JOIN is by the condition,
the condition will only apply on the right table instead of the left table:
the rows on the left table will be received either way even if they don't have a 
connection with the rows on the right table.

in the next example I would like to receive a list of employees and their phone numbers,
but I also would like to receive employees which does not possess a phone number.

=> SELECT e.firstName,e.lastName,p.phone FROM employees e 
   LEFT JOIN phones p ON e.employeeID = p.employeeID;
   
result:

                firstName:   lastName:      phone:
                ___________________________________
                Dikla        Alon         024113265
                Dikla        Alon         048876542
                Avi          Aviel        NULL     <--------------
                Vered        Levi         036654198
                Haim         Moshe        050669425
                
                
following the result above, I can see that the employee "Avi Aviel" does not
have a phone number but despite this fact he is still included in my combined table.
because while using LEFT JOIN state is used for getting data from all rows even if
a certain row's value inside a table isn't connected to other column in another table.

* important to note:

each time I would like to get data which some rows does not have a connection to other rows
I can use LEFT JOIN. using JOIN/INNER JOIN is forcing me to get data that is only connected
by a matter.


RIGHT JOIN example:

there is not much diffrence between RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN, the fact that
while using RIGHT JOIN - the table which I would like to receive data from will
be on the right side and not the left side according to the JOIN state.

=> SELECT e.firstName,e.lastName,p.phone FROM phones p 
   RIGHT JOIN employees e ON e.employeeID = p.employeeID;
   
result:

                firstName:   lastName:      phone:
                ___________________________________
                Dikla        Alon         024113265
                Dikla        Alon         048876542
                Avi          Aviel        NULL     <--------------
                Vered        Levi         036654198
                Haim         Moshe        050669425
                
                
                
* important to note:

most programmers would prefer LEFT JOIN state for onvenience.
while using LEFT JOIN the left table is the "main" table.
