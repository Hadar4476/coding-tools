there are several types to "JOIN":

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- JOIN

there is no diffrence between JOIN and INNER JOIN because the default behavior of
mysql server while using JOIN is to use the INNER JOIN instead.

example:

=> SELECT c.name,p.title,p.price FROM products p
   JOIN categories c ON c.id = p.categorie_id
   WHERE p.visibility = 1
   ORDER BY p.price
   LIMIT 3;
