for deleting data/rows from a certain table I can use the DELETE FROM
command, if I won't mention which row I want to delete with WHERE condition-
all the record will get deleted:

=> DELETE FROM contact_log WHERE id = 1;

* important thing to note:

if I will want to delete all, not use the condition WHERE, then mysql server
will delete the whole table.

there is another for deleting the row of a certain table but keep the table and
the columns:

TRUNCATE TABLE contact_log;

the diffrence between DELETE & TRUNCATE:
---------------------------------------

if will delete all the rows from a table with DELETE command - 
a column which has A_I and primary key won't receive the value of 1 after
using the DELETE COMMAND, instead it will receive the A_I number - deleting
all rows won't reset the general data on the table.
