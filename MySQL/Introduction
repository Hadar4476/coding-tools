After downloading XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
I should run xampp-control.exe, after that click the shell button and open
XAMPP cmd, type "mysql -u root -p" to start the mysql server.
it is possible with pressing the Admin button in MySQL line in the GUI(XAMPP control)
to enter http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ or I can type this in the browser.
