mysql server is using two engines for executing storing and getting data from tables:

- InnoDB
- MyISAM

while creating a table it is possible to define which engine will support the mysql server,
for storing the data inside that table. it is important to mention that is not a must thing to
define -the default engine is InnoDB but there are some differences:


InnoDB:                                                       MyISAM:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Newer                                                            - Oldest
      
- Default engine                                                   - Not default anymore
      
- Is more useful for working with large amount                     - Less useful for working with large amount
  of data                                                            of data
        
- good performance under load                                      - not so good performance under load
      
- Supports transactions                                            - Does not support transactions
      
- Fast writing for tables(not locking/blocking the                 - Slow writing for tables(does lock/block from
  file from reading or writing in parallel connections)              reading or writing in parellel connections)
        
- Performs slightly retrieval operations a little slower           - Performs retrieval operations a little bit faster

- Until the latest versions do not allow to perform a search       - Allows you to perform a search (full text search) and 
 (full text search) and create indexes on text-type fields           create indexes on Text-type fields

there are more engines that mysql server can get supported by, but they are less popular
and were meant for specific tasks. 

however, mysql server is supported by the following engines:

- Memory - a table which is saved only in the ram memory and restarts with every restart of
  the database.
- BlackHole - a blackhole table, it is not really saving the data anywhere.
- Archieve - an archive table, which can manage a great amount of data, but will cost
  functionality.
- CSV - comma seperated values.


defining an engine:

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cities 
    (
    id int(11) NOT NULL,
    name varchar(255) NOT NULL
    ) 
=>  ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
