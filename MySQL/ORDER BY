mysql server is allowing me to order the received rows with the ORDER BY command.
there are three types of ordering:

- ASC : ascending, means sort in ascending order, from the lowest value to the highest or a - z.
- DESC : descending, means sort in descending order, from the highest value to the lowest.
- RAND() : random, means sort randomly.

example for ASC:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE price >= 75 
   ORDER BY price ASC;
   
   
example for DESC:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   ORDER BY lastName DESC;
   
   
example for RAND():

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees ORDER BY RAND();

massive ordering:

mysql server is allowing to sort by more than one criterion:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   ORDER BY lastName ASC,firstName ASC;
