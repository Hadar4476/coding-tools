how to add records/rows into a table?

for example, I will add a new row to categories table, the categories table is
built like this(DESC categories):



Field         Type                 Null      Key       Default      Extra
__________________________________________________________________________________
id            int(11)              NO        PRI       NULL         auto_increment

name          varchar(255)         NO                  NULL

machine_name  varchar(255)         NO                  NULL




now for the inser of a new row:

=> INSERT INTO categories VALUES('','New cat','new-cat');

I don't have to pass id because it is defined as primary key and A_I(auto increment),
my sql server will take care of the value automatically.



multi insert:

there is a possibility to insert multi rows:

=> INSERT INTO categories VALUES
=> ('','New cat 2','new-cat-2'),
=> ('','New cat 3','new-cat-3'),
=> ('','New cat 4','new-cat-4');
 

insert into specific columns:

sometimes I would like to insert a new row but only pass data from that row to specific column or columns"

=> INSERT INTO contact_log(name,phone) VALUES('Name demo 3','036630012');
