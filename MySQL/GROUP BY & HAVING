the HAVING state is an optional while working with GROUP BY state.
this is useful for stating a condition or conditions on rows after grouping these rows.
In contrast to the WHERE state which allows conditions on rows and their original data,
the HAVING state allows stating conditions on rows after grouping the data(including data
that don't actually exist in the original table).

in the next example I would like to count how many employees are living in each city but
we want to receive only cities which there are more than 1 employee.

=> SELECT city,COUNT(*) AS amount FROM employees
   GROUP BY city HAVING amount > 1;
   
result:

city:                   amount:
----                    ------

Petach Tikva            2
Ramat Gan               2
Tel Aviv                2


*important to note:
the HAVING state is known for "devourering" resources and is not very useful when talking about
performance, but there is a possibility to state a condition with WHERE and it is more 
recommanded than HAVING.
