The BETWEEN state is allowing us mainly in working with columns that contain
numerical information and helps us to set conditions of a range from a certain
number to a certain number. In the following example we would like to extract
from the product table products whose price ranges from 50 (inclusive) to 100
(inclusive) and for this purpose we use the BETWEEN statement:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 100;
