the GROUP BY state is helpful for grouping data by a certain criterion,
so we can receive data by groups. GROUP BY is using the DISTINCT state automaticly.

in the example I will want to group all the cities from the "employees" table by a city:

=> SELECT city FROM employees
   GROUP BY city;
   
result:

city:
----
Petach Tikva
Ramat Gan
Tel Aviv
Uno

GROUP and COUNT:

it is possible to add more information when using GROUP BY state.

in the next example I would like to get the amount of employees living in the same city:

=> SELECT city,COUNT(*) AS amount FROM employees
   GROUP BY city;

result:

city:                   amount:
----                    ------
Petach Tikva            2
Ramat Gan               2
Tel Aviv                2
Uno                     1

using conditions:

in the next example I would like to get the amount of employees living in the same city but only
from rows that their status is equal to 1:

=> SELECT city,COUNT(*) AS amount FROM employees
   WHERE status = 1
   GROUP BY city
   ORDER BY city ASC;
   
result:

city:                   amount:
----                    ------
Petach Tikva            2
Ramat Gan               1
Tel Aviv                2
