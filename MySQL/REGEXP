before I start there a much wider explanation on NodeJS/REGEX folder.

in mysql the REGEXP state is useful for searching with REGEX.

in the example below I want to search employees from the "employees" table which 
their city they live in start with the letter R or T.

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   WHERE city REGEXP '^[RT]';
   
result:

firstName:            lastName:              city:
---------             --------               ----

Avi                   Aviel                  Ramat Gan
Haya                  Bitun                  Tel Aviv
Moshe                 Cohen                  Ramat Gan
Israel                Israeli                Tel Aviv


in the next example I would like to find employees that their name
contains only 4 characters:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   WHERE firstName REGEXP '^.{4}$';
   
result:

firstName:            lastName:              city:
---------             --------               ----

Haim                  Moshe                  Petach Tikva
Haya                  Bitun                  Tel Aviv
