Another constraint that can be set on a table is called AUTO INCREMENT or A_I for short
(as it appears in the phpmyadmin interface) but can only be set on a column defined as PRIMARY KEY.
Mysql server in sequential numerical order (in ascending order). This setting is excellent
for example for a column named id so that each new record will have its own unique id in
ascending order automatically in order.

in the next query we will create a new table called users_demo in which we will define the column
id as the main key of the table (primary key) and we will define this column which will get its
values automatically by the setting AUTO_INCREMENT. As UNIQUE and the column description as FULLTEXT index:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_demo (
  id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  password varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  profile_image varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  updated_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  KEY name (name),
  UNIQUE KEY email (email),
  FULLTEXT KEY description (description)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
