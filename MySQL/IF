the IF function is useful for setting a condition, it receives 3 arguments:

- the first one: the condition.
- the second one: what will happen if that condition is true.
- the third one: what will happen if that condition is false.

example:

=> SELECT title,price, 
   IF(visibility = 1, 'visible', 'not visible') AS vis 
   FROM products;
