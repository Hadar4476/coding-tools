the DISTINCT is helpful for mapping through rows which their values are the same, 
so I can receive unique values when I will run queries.

in the example below I would like to receive the distinct city from the "employees"
table but only from row that their satus is equal to 1:

=> SELECT DITINCT city FROOM employees WHERE status = 1;

result:

city:
----
Ramat Gan
Petach Tikva
Tel Aviv
