Schema, this is a definition that describes how we want the table to look and
what components it will contain. The mysql server does not allow the creation
of tables without "pre-planning" in which we define which columns the table will
have and which data type each column will contain. And there are a number of other
settings that we will define a table when we create a new table on the mysql server.
Therefore Schema is a diagram of the same table and description of the table we want
to create and we on the mysql server (unlike other database software like MongoDB) must
give such a description of the table structures, the parts it will contain, and the data types it will include.
