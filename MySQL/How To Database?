Create a database:

There are two ways to create a database in MySql:

- via the Shell interface with a query: CREATE DATABASE database_demo;
- via the visual interface - phpmyadmin.

*important thing to note:
it is impossible to create two databases with the same name,
if I do so it will lead me to this error: "Can't create database database exists".

Collation, what is that?

Collation is a definition of the method of encoding the data stored in tables
as well as a set of rules and regulations regarding the encoding of characters
and symbols. By default when we create a database the encoding method is latin1_swedish_ci
which does not allow for example data storage in Hebrew etc. etc. but only in English and
Swedish (originally mysql was developed by a Swedish company). 
Of course you can do that later in the CREATE DATABASE statement:

=> CREATE DATABASE database_demo_2 CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

- utf8: means, storing data for any kind of language.
- utf8_general_ci: a general and recommanded encodiong method of the encoding method utf8.
- ci: means, case insensitive - setting the database to case insensitive.

Show databbases:

I can also check my databases with a command in the Shell interface:

=> SHOW DATABASES;

or:

=> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;


Use database:

=> USE database_demo;


Delete a database:

When I query a database using a query I can use the DROP DATABASE statement after
which I will specify the name of the database I want to delete. It should be emphasized
that deleting a database will delete all the tables and records that that database contains.
By default mysql server does not back up the database so it is advisable to back up the database before deleting.

How to back up a database:

- open phpmyadmin.
- click the database you want to back up.
- press export(ייצוא).
- change Format to SQL.
- click on go(ביצוע).


How to import a database:

first, I need to use a certain database with USE *some database name*,
then, I want to type the following command

=> SOURCE *file location - can be executed with right clicking a file - properties - location*\*some sql file name*.sql

* important thing to note:

The SOURCE command must not end with a semicolon. It is also possible that the 
sql file on your computer is in a different folder and probably not in the above code!
