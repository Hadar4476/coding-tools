the SUBQUERY term is meant for using a sub query inside a query.
SUBQUERY starts and ends with (), for me to tell which is the main query
and which is the sub.

in the next example I would like to recive data from products table,
from title and price columns and my condition is only receive data by
the fact that the price value is greater than what the sub query returns,
which is the avg price of the products.

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
   
result:

      title:             price:

SUBQUERY and JOINS:

in the next example I would like to receive in % the sum of all products that belongs
to a categorie in the categories table:

=> SELECT c.name,
   ROUND(SUM(p.price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(price) FROM products),2) percentages
   FROM products p
   JOIN categories c ON c.id = p.categorie_id
   GROUP BY c.name 
   ORDER BY percentages;
      
result:

      name:               percentages:
