the select command is useful for receiving data from a table.
there is a possibility to mention which columns I want to get data from,
from the table.
the * sign means all columns:

=> SELECT * FROM categories;

receiving data from specific columns:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products;

SELECT & WHERE:

=> SELECT firstName,lastName,city FROM employees
   WHERE city = 'Tel Aviv';
   
in this case I want to receive data from the firstName,lastName and city columns from the employees
table but only where the value for the rows that their city column's value is equal to 'Tel Aviv'.


operators:

there is a possibility to use operators with WHERE condition:
- less then ( < )
- greater then ( > )
- equal to ( = )

for example:

=> SELECT title,price FROM products
   WHERE price > 100;
