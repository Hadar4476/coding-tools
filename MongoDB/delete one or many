collection(users) structural:

[
{
username: "hadar"
},
{
username: "hadar"
},
{
username: "hadar"
},
{
username: "hadar"
},
{
username: "amir"
}
]

//delete one:

db.users.remove({username:"hadar"},1)

will delete the first one that follows the condition!
although if I change the one to 2 or 3 or 10 nothing will happen, only one will get deleted.

//delete many

db.users.remove({username:"hadar"})

not setting an integer after the object will give me the result of deleting all.
