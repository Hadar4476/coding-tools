because mongo is schemaless,the process of creating and inserting is much easier.
unless sql that you need to follow by certain steps before you can move on to other steps(multiple line of code)

creating in sql:

access to the mysql with mysql powershell first:

mysql -u root -p
*press enter twice

CREATE DATABASE test
 
 USE test
 
 CREATE TABLE table_for_test
 (id int(11) NOT NULL,
 title varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 body text NOT NULL,
 is_published tinyint(1) NOT NULL);
 
* in the examples below I can see that first I need to create a database and than use it but with mongo I can just type "use test"
  and what will happen is mongo will reconise that this database dosen't exist and will create a new one plus will 
  give me access to use it right away so i can create collection and fill it with information.
  
* same thing with inserting into a table, in sql i can't create a table without setting columns to it.
  if I would like to create a collection in mongo with db.createCollection("collection_for_test") I won't get an error,
  the collection is created but there is nothing inside unlike sql that won't even create it.

* I can create a collection in mongo with "db.createCollection("some_collection") and 
  than type "db.some_collection.insert(Array/Object)", *but* there is another, simple way to create and insert:

- db.some_collection.insert(Array/Object);
