If I would like to add some conditions for the information I need I can type a condition.

for example, If I want to get a field of a document, in this case "ticketPrice", 
that its value is greater than and equal to 52($gte), afterwards I want to get only the following field:
"title" and "ticketPrice" but not an additional "_id".

db.ads.find({"ticketPrice": { $gte: 52 }}, {"title": 1, "ticketPrice":1, _id: 0}).pretty()

result:

{ 
  "title" : "Infected mushroom return to the sauce", 
  "ticketPrice" : 63 
}
{ 
  "title" : "Rock with metallica", 
  "ticketPrice" : 52 
}
