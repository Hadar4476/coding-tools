Lets say that in my main.handlebars I want to link a script and that script
will be use as an alert for something or even a validation for my
contact.handlebars form.

first of all it common among programmers to create a public folder,
inside that public folder to create 3 folders:
- images
- js
- css

in my main.handlebars file I'm going to use <script> tag that its source(src) will be:

=> <script src="js/script.js"></script>

in that script.js file I will just alert("Hello I'm here").

now if I will refresh that localhost:3000 I can't see the alert, more than that if
I press f12 and got to network and refresh again I can see "script.js" in red
and if I click on headers I can see that the status code is "404 not found", which means
it can't reach this file.

how can I make it work?
I can set a get method in the app.js for that script but what if it's not just one script
but 50 or not even scripts, lets say I have 500 images in my server I want to display,
typing app.get for each one is not a good solution.

instead I can do it like this:
in the app.js file:

=> app.use(express.static("public"));

means that the use method is a middleware that can help me use all my files in the public folder as static files,
which means I don't have to type app.get a thousand times.
