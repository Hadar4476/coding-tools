First, a middleware is a very popular concept while working with framework.
lets say I have an application, and there is a certain page which is only accesable for
a user who wrote a right email and password(sign in).
I need to check the user data(email and password in this case) I can use a middleware which
will check the request data that was sent according to what I decide.
if the data is valid response with the page if not - don't.
the middleware pops in the middle of the proccess when the request from the browser is sent 
to the server.

for example:
the use method in express is used for middlewares.
