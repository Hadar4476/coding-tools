Rules in Regex and How To?
__________________________

1. Regular expressions always start and end with / (/ <word, character, letter, number, etc.> /).

2. If I write only a word, letter, character or number within the regular expression (/ /),
regex will perform a simple search on the data, without a template,
that is, it will find the data simply as its meaning.

regular expression: /hadar/

string:             hadar yamin
                    _____
        
3. Regex is case sensetive(big and small letters).

        
        
        
Modes,What does that mean?
_________________________

1) GLOBAL MODE:

For example, suppose I have searched for a word that appears several times,
by default in javascript as long as I do not specify "status" at the end of
the regular expression, it will always search and bring only the first instance
in which the word appears. Therefore this mode needs to be changed to a global mode.
how? In this way: / blablabla / g.
It is very important to note that the syntax of using situations is done by writing them out of expression.

without global mode:

regular expression: /hadar/

string:             hadar yamin hadar yamin
                    _____
        
        
with global mode:
________________

regular expression: /hadar/g

string:             hadar yamin hadar yamin
                    _____       _____
            
       
       
       
2) INSENSETIVE MODE:

this mode is for making the regular  expression not case sensetive(insensetive).

without insensetive mode:
________________________

regular expression: /hadar/

string:             HADAR yamin 



with insensetive mode:
_____________________


regular expression: /hadar/i

string:             HADAR yamin 
                    _____
        

3) MULTILINE MODE:

Supports situations that the data we want to look for is not just in one row (line down)
but in another, below it. 
* Not so important in javascript according to Shlomi.

- SIGNS - 

1. the dot sign(.): there are two usages for this sign:
                    - finding the actual sign ".", how?
                    
                    regular expression:  /\./
                    
                    string:              hadar yamin.
                                                    _
                       
                    - finding all characters, digits & signs individually(means all), how?
                    
                     regular expression:  /./
                    
                    string:              hadar yamin.
                                         ____________
                                         
                                  

2. create a set([]). lets say I would like to find the letters "h" and "Y":
                     I can use a set to tell regex, I want you to find this by a set 
                     of these, how?
                        
                     regular expression:  /[hY]/
                    
                     string:              hadar Yamin.
                                         _
                             
                     *important thing to note here*
                     since I havn't used global mode(g), regex found the first case
                     it encountered.
                     
                     to fix it I can type like this:
                     
                     regular expression:  /[hY]/g
                    
                     string:              hadar Yamin.
                                          _     _
                                          
 
3) set a range( [-] ). lets say I want to check only for digits between 0-9 in my string.
                       I can combine set and range. how? like this:
                       
                        regular expression:  /[0-9]/g
                    
                        string:              0505640800 8699377
                                             __________ _______
                          
                        
                        *important thing to note here*
                        regex found each digit individually in this case.
                        the range dosen't have to be from 0-9, A-Z or a-z
                        it can be, for example:
                        [2-6], [4-5],[3-9]
                        [b-f],[h-o],[a-w]
                        [C-E],[T-S],[K-R]
                        
                        as long as the order of the range is logicly possible
                        regex will find the contant.
                        
                        types of sets:
                        
                        /[0-9]/ - for digits between 0 to 9.
                        /[A-Z]/ - for big letters only between A to Z.
                        /[a-z]/ - for small letters only between a to z.
                        
                        an alternatives for not using /[A-Za-z]/ : 
                        
                        - /[0-9A-Z]/gi 
                        - /[0-9A-z]/g


4)find except( ^ ). this sign is called chaos and is used for finding 
                    notes except specific notes. how? like this:
                    
                    regular expression: /[^0-9]/gm
                    
                    string            : hadar yamin 1234567
                                        ____________
                  
                  

5) an alternative for [0-9] ( \d ). a shortcut for digit,
                                    usage:
                                    
                                    regular expression: /\d/
                                    
                                    string            : hadar yamin 123456
                                                                    ______
                                                                    
                                    except( ^ ) in \d : \D
                                    
                                    regular expression: /\D/
                                    
                                    string            : hadar Yamin 123456 @#$%^&*
                                                        ____________      ________
                                    
                                    
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                        
Examples for Regex:
__________________

1. lets say I want to find s specific string with regex, something like "!05Ads"

conditions:
__________

- the first note dosen't have to be a specific type(digit,letter,sign etc), it can be everything.
- the second note must be 0.
- the third note must be a digit between 0 to 9.
- the fourth note must be a big letter only, from A to Z.
- the fifth note must be a small letter only, from a to z.
- the last note can be whatever.

solution:
________

regular expression:   /.0[0-9][A-Z][a-z]./gm
