In general the get method is sending a request to the server for getting data and
the post is for sending the data- changing an existing data and saving it.

it is possible to pass the server data for processing with the get method.
this data is passed as query string, however data that is passed with the
post method are not passed as query string but through a special mechanism
called "form-data"(WSH).

it is possible to pass data with the get method to the server with a length 
of 2000-3000 characters only, however, with the post method it is possible to
pass a much larger length of characters(depends with the server settings), usually
8mb.

in the classic way, for me to pass a file from the user pc(example: profile image),
it is possible only with the post method. why?
the get method is limited to 2000-3000 characters only.

data that is passed to the server with the get method, is automatically saved in the 
browser's history, additionally that data is possible to save in the favorites(bookmarks).

the get method is faster than the post method. why is that?
data that is passed with get method is passed inside a URL which this method is built from.
however, for data to be passed with the post method a special mechanism is needed - in clinet side
and server side.

when get method?
for forms like searching products, flights, data, images etc. why?
- to give the user an option to save the searched data in favorites(bookmarks).
- get is faster than post.
- for form - there are no sensetive information(example: credit card).

when post method?
