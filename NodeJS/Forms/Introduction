Forms are necessary for passing data from the broswer to my code/server etc.
More importantly is: search engines and programs that are suppose to help
to disable people have detection capability for the site elements.

for example:

   <form>
=> <label>Your Fullname:</label>
   <input type="text">
   </form>

the search engine and those helpful programs knows that <label> tags are connected to <input> tags.
if instead of  the <label> tag I will place a <span> tag, this span won't be connected
to that input.

how can the search engine/ programs will know that my <label> tag is connected to my <input> tag?

with the attribute "for" I can attach the <input> tag's ID to the <label> tag like this:

  <form>
=> <label for="fullname">Your Fullname:</label>
=> <input type="text" id="fullname">
   </form>
   
how will I know if those elements are connected?   
by click on the label element in the website I can see that as soon as I click,
I can transferred to the input field.

that is very important because some people dosen't have the ability to see how the
website is built or they can't use the mouse, so they use the TAB key or some program
to help them with reading the website. so if someone is using the TAB key
once he will get to the <label> tag and click TAB again he will transferr to the input field
because they are connected by the "for" attribute.

for people that aren't able to see my website(blind) there are special programs that
can read for them the contant in my website. so if a blind person gets to the <label>
tag, the program will read it for the person as "<input> tag's field", for example in the
example above it will be: "fullname's field" so he/she will know that he/she needs to fill
their fullname.

sometimes when I will take the services of a graphic designer he/she will tell me that
there is no space in the website for the label, so how can I fix that?

I can just set a label tag but giving it with style or class "display-none"/"d-none",
from the dom point of view it won't show but for the search engine it will. I can also place
a placeholder like "Please Enter Fullname Here" for the graphic designer request.

required attribute, what is that?

this attribute will prevent the submiting of the form if this attribute sits
on some input tag and if that input tag is empty the submiting will cancel and 
alert that it must be filled.

In the default behavior of HTML5, if I'm using a form it will validate the fields.
why would I want to prevent the validation of HTML5 form?
imagine a situation which a hacker can go to my website click on inspect mode,
and start editing my html:
for example, he will edit the type of my email-input to text, delete the require from other
input etc. the changes he made only apply to his browser that's ok but if he can edit the elements,
he can get around the validation of HTML5 form and send empty fields to my server.

how can I slove this?
novalidate attribute, what is that?

it means that I tell the HTML5 form, don't do your validate I will handle the validate.
usage:

=> <form novalidate="novalidate">
