first, I need to run the command in terminal/cmd - npm i mysql.
than requiring that module:

=> const mysql = requrire("mysql");

after that make a connection to the data base with the method createConnection
which recives a literal object with properties of host, user, password and the database
I would like to use:


=> const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    user: "root",
    password: "",
=>  database: "eshop",
   });
   
for the actual connection:
   
=> connection.connect();

for the query to the database:
=> const sql = "SELECT * FROM products;"

after that, the query method gets 2 parameters:

1) the query.


2)an anonymus function:
- the error, which will be displayed like in the Shell interface, if it did successfully could get data or not: can be a Syntax error etc.
- the data which will be recived via the query
- and the collation, the fields

=> connection.query(sql, (err, data, collation) => {
     if (err) console.error(err);
     else console.log(data);     
   });
