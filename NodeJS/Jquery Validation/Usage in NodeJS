for the validation, first I will create a js file:

script.js:

=> $("#contact-form").validate({
=>   rules: {
=>     fullname_field: {
=>       required: true,
=>       minlength: 3,
=>       maxlength: 70,
=>     },
=>     email_field: {
=>       required: true,
=>       email: true,
=>     },
=>     phone_field: {
=>       required: true,
=>       minlength: 9,
=>       maxlength: 10,
=>       digits: true,
=>     },
=>   },
=> });

line 5: getting the form's id and starting the validate method.
line 6: the validate method takes an object with property "rules".
line 7,12 & 16: this property/object will need to be identical to the input's name attribute.
line 8,13 & 17: telling the validate that these fields are required - means you can't continue
                if those fields are empty or have false information according to the validate rules.
line 9 & 18: the minlength property is telling the validate how many minimun characters we want the user
             to enter inside that field.
line 10 & 19: the maxlength property is the same as minlength but just as a maximum length espect.
line 14: we want to validate that this is an email field so it will give all the properties of a proper email
         and will display relevant errors.
line 20: we want to set the phone field as digits only.

must mention that when we will enter a false data inside those fields we will get an error.
that error is a label that adds to the bottom of the input, that label has .error class which I can style 
in a css file and give it color = red for example:

  .error{
    color:"red";
  }
