Express is a very popular framework in NodeJS, which allows
programmers to build a web app easily and conveniently with some build-in
tools in express.
to create uniformity and one known way for programming in teams, it's common
to use a framework. so thats why express is the most popular framework within
NodeJS for programmers(12m downloads a week). express includes many modules for writing
code and building a project in very fast and convenient way(instead of building everything from
scratch). this framework also called "ecosystem" - it does not perfect and also it does not 
include all the tools, but, you can always download additional modules or libraries for your
desires.

the most popular option that express suggest us is to build our own web server for the site/project
in a very organized and readable way with only few lines of code. 

how to install? 

=> npm i express
