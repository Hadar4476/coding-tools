lets say that I have a main file which contains a navbar
and I want to give the user an access to navigating through several path and in
these paths I will response the user with a certain html file.

a good example will be lets say I have a navbar with:
- home
- about
- contact us

I want the user to stay inside my main page but when clicking about he will get
the about.html file. that is why I need handlebars template here.

After installing handlebars with npm i express-handlebars, in my App.js I need to require
some modules:

=> const express = require("express");
=> const exphbs = require("express-handlebars");

in Line 18: 
   I'm actually requiring the handlebars framework from express.
   
=> const app = express();

=> app.engine("handlebars",exphbs());

line 25: In this line i'm telling express which engine it should use,
         in that case: handlebars as string which will decide the name of that framework. 
         the engine method also take a reuirement of the actual framework: in that case:
         exphbs();
      
      
=> app.set("view engine","handlebars");

line 33: In this I'm setting the view engine that I want to use as handlebars.
