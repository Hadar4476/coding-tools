for me to connect my database in mongodb to my nodejs I need to run the command:

* npm i mongoose

mongoose is a module for working with mongodb databases and connecting to them.
in my app.js file I will require mongoose inside a const:

=> const mongoose = require("mongosse");

then I will actually need to create the connection to my database:

=> mongoose.connect();

with this method I can now connect to my database in mongodb, this method gets 2 parametrs:

- the address which is separated to two parts: "mongodb://localhost/" and the database: "eshop" for example.
  result: "mongodb://localhost/eshop".
- a literal object for certain premission: { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true}.

after that because the connect is returning a promise I can use then & catch methods:

=> mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/querytest", {
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
    useNewUrlParser: true,
  })
  .then(()=>{
  console.log("connected to mongodb");
  })
  .catch(err =>{
  console.log(err);
  })
  
if the connection was successful it will console.log("connected to mongodb") and if not it will display
the error causing it with the catch method.
