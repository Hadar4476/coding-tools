FIrst, if I download express with npm i express - the body-parser module is already in there.
I can require it like this:

=> const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

now I can call the use method so I can actually use it like this:
=> app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

the urlencoded actually takes the data and passing it as literal object,
the "extended" property is for telling the parser to parse only the form data not every data.

now I will be able to console.log(req.body) and get the data.
