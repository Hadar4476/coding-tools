bcrypt is a module for encoding senstive information like user's password etc.

first, I will need to run the command:

=> npm i bcrypt

after that lets say that I have a mongoose model called "User", this model
receives as parameter the req.body, which is basically the user information.
now while I'm getting this information the password isn't encoded, if I won't
use bcrypt everyone who has access to my database can see my users passwords.

to slove it, first I need a variable to hold that model:

=> let user = new User(req.body);

and then, there is some term in bcrypt called "salt" and it use for holding
a method of bcrypt called genSalt which returns a promise, and this method receives
as parameter the saltRounds which has a meaning in google just need to look it up:

=> const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);

for setting the password to the encoded password using bcrypt's hash method which receives
2 parameters:

- the sensetive data I would like to encode.
- the variable that hold the genSlat method(salt).

=> user.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password,salt);

in the next example I want to simulate a situation when the user signed up to my website,
and now he wants to sign in. because I used the hash method(check NodeJS/Projects with Shlomi/my-rest-api-copy/routes/users.js for
more info) I don't have a way to validate the req.body.password the user sends to my password in the database.
what I can use is bcrypt.compare method(check NodeJS/Projects with Shlomi/my-rest-api-copy/routes/auth.js for
more info), what this method will do is "remembering" how the encoded password looked like and will "compile" it
to the original password which the user send:

=>  const validPassowrd = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
