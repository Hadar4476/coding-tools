A new technology coming in 2009, together with html 5 and together with a new class in javascript called web socket.
This technology is used as a replacement, more efficiently and better,
the technique that was previously accepted as "non-pulling", which had quite a few drawbacks. such as:
- Very high resource consumption from the server.
- Falls in the communication and more.
web socket does not use http and https protocols, which do not allow two-way communication, 
only ex-duplex communication (a user must send a request to the server). While web socket, 
works on pcp / ip protocol. So that we can open two-way communication without the need to send requests, that is, full-duplex.
Nowadays, web socket, are used for online chats, video streaming, online computer games, push notification and more.
